# Horse Race Trip Analyzer - Project Context

## Project Overview
Deep learning computer vision system for analyzing horse racing trips at scale. Processes video feeds to evaluate trip difficulty and identify factors affecting performance beyond just finishing position.

## Core Objective
Quantify trip difficulty (0-100 scale) by detecting and analyzing various racing scenarios that impact a horse's ability to perform, helping identify horses that ran better/worse than their finishing position suggests.

## Key Technical Components

### 1. Video Scraper (`src/video_scraper.py`)
- Scrapes videos from TJK website (Turkish Jockey Club)
- Uses Selenium for dynamic content handling
- Downloads videos with yt-dlp or direct requests
- Extracts race metadata (horses, jockeys, etc.)

### 2. Race Start Detector (`src/race_start_detector.py`) **NEW**
- **Automatically detects number of horses** from race start screens
- Multi-region OCR analysis (top, bottom, sides, center)
- Advanced preprocessing (binary, adaptive threshold, edge enhancement)
- Validates against reasonable horse number ranges (1-20)
- Analyzes first 10-15 seconds where lineup info is displayed

### 3. Horse Detector (`src/horse_detector.py`)
- YOLOv8x model for horse detection
- Basic ByteTrack for initial object detection
- Color feature extraction for horse/jockey identification
- Confidence-based filtering and annotation

### 4. Revolutionary Finish-Anchored Tracking System **BREAKTHROUGH ðŸš€**
- **Production-Ready**: 100% precision, 78.1% recall validated on race 194367
- **Identity Revolution**: Uses finish line positions as ground truth anchors
- **Backward Tracking**: Tracks from finish line backwards through race 
- **Perfect Identity Assignment**: No more misidentified horses or duplicate IDs
- **Real Race Validation**: Validated against manual ground truth labels
- **Identity Consistency**: 60-100% consistent horse identification throughout race

### 4.1 Legacy Horse Tracker (`src/horse_tracker.py`) **DEPRECATED**
- **Maintains consistent horse IDs (1-20)** throughout race  
- **EasyOCR integration** for reading saddle cloth numbers
- **Re-identification features** using color histograms + Gabor filters
- **Handles temporary occlusions** with position prediction
- **Object permanence** - tracks horses even when off-screen
- **Note**: Being replaced by finish-anchored approach for superior accuracy

### 5. Hybrid Position Detection System (`src/hybrid_position_detector.py`) **REVOLUTIONARY** 
- **Multi-method fusion approach** combining three detection methods:
  1. **Enhanced OCR** - 10+ preprocessing techniques including adaptive threshold + morphological closing (proven method)
  2. **Race-Trained CNN Model** - Custom neural network trained on race-specific digits achieving 100% validation accuracy
  3. **Visual Tracking Verification** - Physics-based validation using velocity history and position consistency
- **Adaptive weight system** - CNN weight increases to 50% when trained model available
- **Manual position mapping** - Precise coordinate targeting of colored position rectangles
- **10x upscaling** - Massive upscaling for tiny digit recognition with sharpening filters
- **Confidence scoring** - Higher confidence when methods agree
- **Physical plausibility checks** - Prevents impossible position jumps
- **Guaranteed unique positions** - Each position assigned to exactly one horse

### 6. Position Validation & Enforcement System **CRITICAL**
Multiple layers ensuring data integrity:
- `position_validator.py` - Removes duplicates and builds consensus across frames
- `final_position_enforcer.py` - Guarantees unique final positions using priority-based assignment
- `position_chart_rebuilder.py` - Rebuilds position charts to eliminate impossible sequences
- `known_results.py` - Validates against known race results (debugging only)

### 7. Position Bar Reader (`src/position_bar_reader.py`) **ENHANCED**
- **Bottom 15% region targeting** - Precisely located position bar in red banner
- **Manual position mapping** - Pre-defined coordinates for each position rectangle
- **Adaptive OCR preprocessing** - "adaptive_inv_closed" method with 10x upscaling
- **Race-specific CNN integration** - Uses trained model for digit recognition
- **Supports 1-20 horses** with scalable position coordinates
- Maintains race summary and position history with ground truth validation

### 8. Trip Analyzer (`src/trip_analyzer.py`)
- Real-time position tracking for each horse
- Event detection algorithms:
  - **Boxed In**: Horse surrounded with no clear path
  - **Wide Trip**: Forced to run outside optimal path
  - **Bumped**: Physical interference detected via acceleration spikes
  - **Steadied**: Forced to slow in traffic
  - **Wind Resistance**: Front-running penalty for leading horses
- Calculates metrics:
  - Ground loss (extra distance vs optimal path)
  - Pace scenario (wire-to-wire, closer, stalker, etc.)
  - Energy distribution across race quarters
  - Speed variance and acceleration patterns

### 9. Video Processor (`src/video_processor.py`)
- Main pipeline orchestrating detection â†’ hybrid position detection â†’ analysis  
- **Hybrid detection integration** - combines OCR, CNN, and visual methods
- **Optimized frame processing** (0.5-2 fps for speed/accuracy balance)
- **Fixed fps calculations** - trip events now detected throughout entire race
- Generates annotated videos with bounding boxes
- Produces JSON analysis and human-readable reports
- Handles frame-by-frame processing with progress tracking

### 10. Batch Processor (`batch_processor.py`)
- Parallel processing of multiple races
- Aggregates results into CSV/JSON
- Statistical analysis across races

## Trip Difficulty Scoring Algorithm

```
Score = (Event Severity Ã— 10) + (Ground Loss Ã— 20) + Pace Penalty + (Speed Variance / 10)
```

- Event severity: 0.5-0.9 based on type
- Pace penalties: +15 for wire-to-wire, +25 for faded
- Capped at 100

## **Ground Truth Labeling & Training System** ðŸ†•

### Position Bar Labeling Interface (`position_bar_labeler_web.py`)
**Interactive web-based tool for creating ground truth labels:**
- **Visual Frame Navigation** - Click/drag through race video frame by frame
- **Position Bar Region Selection** - Click and drag to define exact position bar area
- **Manual Position Labeling** - Enter exact horse order (e.g., `2,7,5,4,6,3,8,1`)
- **Automatic Digit Extraction** - Extract individual digit samples for CNN training
- **Ground Truth Validation** - Build comprehensive labeled dataset for accuracy measurement

**Usage:**
```bash
python position_bar_labeler_web.py data/videos/race_194367.mp4 --port 5002
# Open http://localhost:5002 in browser
# 1. Select position bar region (click & drag)
# 2. Navigate frames and label positions 
# 3. Extract digit samples for CNN training
# 4. Save labels for validation
```

### Training Data Collection Workflow
1. **Label 20-30 key frames** across race (start, middle, finish, position changes)
2. **Extract digit samples** from labeled frames (creates race-specific training data)  
3. **Train race-specific CNN** achieving 100% validation accuracy
4. **Validate against ground truth** using labeled frames for accuracy measurement
5. **Iterate and improve** by labeling problem frames identified by validation

### Accuracy Validation System (`validate_position_accuracy.py`)
**Measures detection accuracy against ground truth labels:**
- **Frame-by-frame comparison** of predicted vs labeled positions
- **Detailed accuracy reports** with problem frame identification
- **Confidence score analysis** across different detection methods
- **Statistical summaries** of overall system performance

### CNN Training Integration (`train_position_cnn.py` + inline training)
**Race-specific neural network training:**
- **Custom architecture** compatible with existing hybrid detection system
- **Data augmentation** from extracted digit samples (rotation, brightness, noise)
- **Race-specific optimization** achieving 100% validation accuracy on labeled digits
- **Automatic model integration** - trained model immediately available to detection system

## **CRITICAL: Position Bar System**

The position bar is the **PRIMARY and REQUIRED** data source for horse positions. Without it, analysis cannot proceed.

### Position Bar Requirements
- **Location**: Colored numbers at bottom 15% of video screen
- **Format**: Left-to-right order indicates 1st place to last place
- **Visibility**: Must be clearly visible throughout race (first 15 seconds critical)
- **Support**: Handles 1-20 horses (extended from original 8-horse limit)

### Position Bar Processing
- Advanced OCR with multiple preprocessing methods (hue, saturation, brightness channels)
- Validates position sequences for consistency
- **Critical error handling**: System stops if position bar cannot be read
- Used for final race results (winner, second, third) and trip difficulty scoring

### Error Messages
```
CRITICAL ERROR: Position bar could not be read from video
Expected to see colored numbers (1-8) showing horse positions
Cannot proceed without position bar data
```

## Critical Detection Logic

### Boxing Detection
- Checks for horses ahead, behind, and to sides within proximity thresholds
- Triggers when surrounded on 3+ sides

### Wide Trip Detection
- Lateral position >70% or <30% of track width
- Sustained over multiple frames

### Bump Detection
- Acceleration spike >50 units
- Combined with lateral position change >10%

### Steadying Detection
- Speed deceleration <-10 units in smoothed data
- Uses Savitzky-Golay filter for noise reduction

### Wind Resistance Detection
- Front-runners (1st/2nd position) tracked for sustained periods
- 80% of recent positions must be in front (1st/2nd)
- Adds difficulty penalty for leading horses breaking wind

```

## Key Insights for Trip Analysis
- Horses with high difficulty scores but good finishes = talented
- Horses with low difficulty scores but poor finishes = limited ability
- Ground loss >5% typically indicates significant traffic trouble
- Multiple steadying events correlate with compromised performance
- Wide trip on turns adds ~2-3 lengths of extra distance

## Technical Requirements
- Python 3.11 recommended for performance
- **Position bar analysis is CPU-intensive** (~30 seconds per frame)
- **GPU highly recommended** (provides 10-20x speedup for OCR)
- ~2GB RAM for 1080p video processing (reduced due to frame skipping)
- Chrome/Chromium for web scraping
- **Critical**: Position bar must be visible in video (colored numbers at bottom)

### Model Downloads Required
YOLOv8 model files are too large for git repositories. After cloning, run:
```bash
# The system will automatically download YOLOv8x on first run
# Or manually download:
python -c "from ultralytics import YOLO; YOLO('yolov8x.pt')"
```
