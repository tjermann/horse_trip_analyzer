5. **Video Quality**: Dependent on source video resolution
6. **Frame Sampling**: 0.5-2 fps may miss very brief events

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Setup environment
conda create -n horse_racing python=3.11 -y
conda activate horse_racing
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test single race with TRAINED CNN (recommended for 8-horse races)
python main.py --race-code 194367 --num-horses 8 --save-annotated

# Speed options
