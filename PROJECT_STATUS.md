## Current Limitations

1. **Model Accuracy**: Using generic YOLOv8, not trained on horses specifically
2. **Jockey Identification**: Color detection started but not functional
3. **Track Geometry**: Assumes uniform track, doesn't account for turns
4. **Scale**: Processes ~2-5 fps on GPU, not real-time
5. **Video Quality**: Dependent on source video resolution

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Setup environment
conda create -n horse_racing python=3.11 -y
conda activate horse_racing
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test single race
python main.py --race-code 194367 --save-annotated

# Run batch analysis
python batch_processor.py --race-codes 194367 194368 194369
```

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Improve Detection**: Collect horse racing dataset and fine-tune YOLO
2. **Track Geometry**: Implement turn detection for accurate distance
3. **Results Integration**: Scrape and correlate with official results
4. **Validation**: Compare analysis with expert trip notes
5. **UI Development**: Build web interface for visualization

## Key Files to Review
- `src/trip_analyzer.py` - Core analysis logic
- `src/horse_detector.py` - Detection and tracking
- `main.py` - Entry point and pipeline
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies

## Performance Metrics
- Processing Speed: 2-5 fps (GPU), 0.5-1 fps (CPU)
- Detection Confidence: ~0.3-0.8 (needs improvement)
- Memory Usage: ~4GB for 1080p video
- Batch Capacity: 2-4 parallel videos

## Known Issues
1. Selenium ChromeDriver may need manual setup
2. GPU memory errors on videos >5 minutes
3. Track ID persistence issues across scene cuts
4. False positives on crowd/barriers

## Success Criteria
- Accurately identify 90%+ of trip troubles
- Correlation between difficulty score and underperformance
- Process full race card (10 races) in <30 minutes
- Generate actionable insights for betting strategy
