## Technical Implementation

### CNN Architecture
```python
class PositionBarCNN(nn.Module):
    - Input: 32x32 grayscale digit images
    - 3 Convolutional layers with pooling
    - 3 Fully connected layers with dropout
    - Output: Digit classification (1-8 for current model)
    - Activation: ReLU + LogSoftmax output
```

### Training Configuration
- **Optimizer**: Adam with learning rate 0.001
- **Loss Function**: CrossEntropyLoss
- **Batch Size**: 16
- **Epochs**: 30 (achieved 84.62% accuracy at epoch 13)
- **Data Augmentation**: Random rotation, brightness, noise, blur
- **Validation**: 20% train/validation split with stratification

### Hybrid Weight Logic
```python
# Untrained CNN
if not cnn.is_trained:
    ocr_weight = 0.5, cnn_weight = 0.1, visual_weight = 0.4

# Trained CNN with high confidence
elif avg_ocr_conf > 0.8 and avg_cnn_conf > 0.8:
    ocr_weight = 0.4, cnn_weight = 0.4, visual_weight = 0.2
```

## Performance Improvements
