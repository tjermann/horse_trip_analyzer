## Current Limitations

1. **Model Accuracy**: Using generic YOLOv8, not trained on horses specifically
2. **Track Geometry**: Assumes uniform track, doesn't account for turns  
3. **Video Quality**: Dependent on source video resolution
4. **OCR Accuracy**: Horse number detection works ~70-80% of the time
5. **Frame Sampling**: May miss very brief events (sub-second incidents)

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Setup environment
conda create -n horse_racing python=3.11 -y
conda activate horse_racing
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test single race (auto-detects horse count, 1 fps default)
python main.py --race-code 194367 --save-annotated

# Force specific horse count
python main.py --race-code 194367 --num-horses 8

# Speed options
python main.py --race-code 194367 --target-fps 2.0  # Higher quality
python main.py --race-code 194367 --target-fps 0.5  # Ultra-fast

# Run batch analysis (auto-detects for each race)
python batch_processor.py --race-codes 194367 194368 194369
```

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Test New Features**: Validate auto-detection and improved tracking on multiple races
2. **Track Geometry**: Implement turn detection for accurate distance calculations
3. **Results Integration**: Scrape and correlate with official results  
4. **Validation**: Compare analysis with expert trip notes
5. **UI Development**: Build web interface for visualization
6. **OCR Improvement**: Fine-tune number recognition for better accuracy

## Key Files to Review
- `src/race_start_detector.py` - **NEW**: Auto horse count detection
- `src/horse_tracker.py` - **NEW**: Improved tracking with re-ID
- `src/trip_analyzer.py` - Core analysis logic
- `src/horse_detector.py` - Basic detection
- `src/video_processor.py` - Main pipeline (updated)
- `main.py` - Entry point (updated with new options)
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies (added EasyOCR)

## Performance Metrics
- Processing Speed: ~30-60 seconds per 3-minute race (1 fps mode)
- Detection Confidence: ~0.3-0.8 (needs improvement)
- Memory Usage: ~2GB for 1080p video (reduced due to frame skipping)
- Batch Capacity: 4-8 parallel videos (CPU optimized)

## Known Issues
1. Selenium ChromeDriver may need manual setup
2. GPU memory errors on videos >5 minutes
3. Track ID persistence issues across scene cuts
4. False positives on crowd/barriers

## Success Criteria
- Accurately identify 90%+ of trip troubles
- Correlation between difficulty score and underperformance
- Process full race card (10 races) in <30 minutes
- Generate actionable insights for betting strategy
