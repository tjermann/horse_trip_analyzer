## Major Breakthrough (2025-09-09) ðŸš€

### CNN Training Pipeline Complete
1. **Trained CNN Model**: Achieved 84.62% validation accuracy on position bar digits
2. **Full Training Infrastructure**: Complete data collection, labeling, and training pipeline
3. **1,944 Training Samples**: Collected from multiple race videos
4. **589 Labeled Samples**: Human-verified training data for digits 1-8
5. **Web-Based Labeling Interface**: User-friendly digit labeling system

### Error Rate Reduction Fixes
1. **CNN Weight Adjustment**: Reduced untrained CNN weight from 40% to 10%
2. **Adaptive Weight System**: Dynamically adjusts weights based on OCR confidence  
3. **Trained CNN Integration**: CNN weight increases to 35-50% when model is trained and confident
4. **Multi-Region OCR**: Tests multiple screen regions for position bar (top/bottom)
5. **Position Continuity**: Validates position changes, reduces confidence for large jumps
6. **Enhanced OCR Preprocessing**: Added multiple ROI regions and preprocessing techniques

## Current Limitations

1. **CNN Model Trained for 8-Horse Races**: Current model supports digits 1-8 only
2. **Generic Vision Model**: YOLOv8 not optimized for horses specifically  
3. **Track Geometry**: Assumes uniform track, doesn't account for turns
4. **Processing Speed**: CPU-only processing ~30-60s per race (GPU would be 10-20x faster)
5. **Video Quality**: Dependent on source video resolution
6. **Frame Sampling**: 0.5-2 fps may miss very brief events

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Setup environment
conda create -n horse_racing python=3.11 -y
conda activate horse_racing
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test single race with TRAINED CNN (recommended for 8-horse races)
python main.py --race-code 194367 --num-horses 8 --save-annotated

# Speed options
python main.py --race-code 194367 --target-fps 2.0  # Higher quality
python main.py --race-code 194367 --target-fps 0.5  # Ultra-fast

# Run batch analysis
python batch_processor.py --race-codes 194367 194368 194369
```

## CNN Training Commands (âœ… COMPLETED)

```bash
# Collect training data from race videos
python collect_training_data.py --video data/videos/race_194367.mp4

# Label samples via web interface
python label_samples_web.py --port 5001

# Train CNN model (COMPLETED - 84.62% accuracy achieved)
python train_position_cnn.py --num-classes 8 --epochs 30 --batch-size 16

# CNN Status: âœ… TRAINED
# - 589 labeled samples for digits 1-8
# - 84.62% validation accuracy  
# - Model auto-loads: models/position_cnn_best.pth
```

## Next Session Priorities

2. **GPU Acceleration**: Optimize for GPU processing (10-20x speedup potential)
3. **Multi-Race Validation**: Test hybrid system on diverse race scenarios
4. **Track Geometry**: Implement turn detection for accurate distance calculations
5. **Results Integration**: Scrape and correlate with official results
6. **Production Pipeline**: Docker containerization and API development

## Key Files to Review

## Performance Metrics
- Processing Speed: ~30-60 seconds per 3-minute race (0.5-2 fps mode)
- Position Detection: Hybrid system with confidence scoring
- Memory Usage: ~2GB for 1080p video (reduced due to frame skipping)
- Batch Capacity: 4-8 parallel videos (CPU optimized)
- Position Accuracy: Guaranteed unique assignments (no duplicate final positions)

## Known Issues
1. **CNN Model Needs Training**: Currently untrained, needs labeled position bar data
2. Selenium ChromeDriver may need manual setup
3. GPU memory optimization needed for CNN inference
4. Track ID persistence issues across scene cuts

## Success Criteria

- âœ… **Trip events throughout race** - Events detected beyond first 10 seconds (ACHIEVED)
- âœ… **Position chart consistency** - No impossible position jumps (ACHIEVED)
